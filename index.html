                            <p><u>How does it work?</u> Once you have selected your year role and agreed to our rules, you can log in using Discord. Discord will then send us your user ID, and we will give you the respective roles, unlocking access to the server.</p>
                
                            <p><u>Is my data safe?</u> Yes. We never receive your email or password, nor do we store your IP address. Discord sends us your user ID, which is not stored anywhere.</p>
                
                            <p><u>I need help!</u> If you are having issues please send a DM to <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/466271091686375424" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><span class="ping">@Mod-Mail</span></a>. A memeber of staff will get back to you ASAP.</p>
